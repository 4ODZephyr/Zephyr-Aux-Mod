- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest) required for running the setup and build scripts on all platforms

- [ArmA 3 Tools](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/) optional but recommended, used for uploading the mod to the workshop, also used by HEMTT for advanced checking I believe
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) config editing, you may use codium or any other editor just be aware that getting the addons may be harder
- [Hemtt addon for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrettMayson.hemtt) adds several nice to have features to VSCode which makes config editing easier and doubles as a PAA viewer
- [EditorConfig for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) makes maintaining a code style partly automatic
