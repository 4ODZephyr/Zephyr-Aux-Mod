## Getting Started
See [meta/doc/Getting_Started.md](meta/doc/Getting_Started.md)

## Requirements
- [HEMTT](https://github.com/synixebrett/HEMTT) (recommended for building and packaging)
- [ArmA 3 Tools](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/) (uploading the mod to the workshop, also used by HEMTT for advanced checking I believe)
- [Visual Sudio Code]() (config editing)
  - [Hemtt addon for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrettMayson.hemtt) (adds several nice to have features to VSCode which makes config editing easier and doubles as a PAA viewer)
  - [EditorConfig for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) (makes maintaining a code style partly automatic)
